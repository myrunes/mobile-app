## Setup

> Following steps only represent the installation on Android.

If you want to test the app yourself or if you want to tinker around with the soucres, you need to set up flutter:
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

After that, clone the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/myrunes/mobile-app.git myrunes/app
```

Following, compile the APK:
```
$ cd myrunes/app
$ flutter build apk --release
```

The final APK is located in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk` directory. Either, you pull the APK directly onto your device and install it manually or run `flutter install` to install it by flutter.

You can also download the [latest CI artifacts](https://github.com/myrunes/mobile-app/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Main+CI%22) containing a release APK. Just select the latest CI run, select the `build` job and download `Release Artifacts`.
